- 👋 Hi, I’m @jgraycox-coa, or Gray Cox at College of the Atlantic and the Quaker Institute for the Future
- 👀 I’m interested in human ecological approaches to programming AI using dialogical reasoning
- that uses practices from studies of reasoning in negotiation, group problem solving, conflict resolution and peacemaking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning approaches to collaborative wisdom in GitHub, Python and AI programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing programming methods for community based collaboration 
- promoting just sustainable peace in a wide variety of contexts 
- and developing spirit-led collaborative workshops using Quaker methods of research. 
- 📫 You can reach me at gray@coa.edu
